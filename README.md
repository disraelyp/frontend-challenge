# FrontEnd Challenges

Here you can find three solved Frontend Challenges. Each challenge is a different task performed by me, mainly focused on my practice in JavaScript, CSS and HTML along with usage of various technologies such as Node.js, Jest, and external APIs. 

The three different tasks here can be found in their sub-folders:

- `./task1`
- `./task2`
- `./task3`, 

Now let's learn more about each task:

## Task1 - Reverse The Array Keeping Special Characters 

This task is all about a simple Node.js program that handles the reversing of an array while keeping the special characters in their original positions. This project shows the apt use of TypeScript, Jest for unit tests along with npm/yarn for managing dependencies. The details about the problem statement and the solution approach can be found in the respective task's README.

## Task2 - Dog's Page

The second task involves creating a web page which makes API fetch requests and displays the list and images of various dog breeds. The data fetched from the API is displayed in two HTML pages in the form of cards and table. Along with HTML and CSS, extensive use of JavaScript can be seen in handling the fetch requests as well processing the data. This can be checked out more in the task specific README.

## Task3 - Interactive Memory Game

The third challenge is a memory matching game created using the basics - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game provides three levels of difficulty that the user can select and start playing. Game dynamics like counting moves and displaying win message have been implemented using plain JavaScript while styling the gameboard was done with CSS.

For each task, usage, installation and deployment details can be seen in the respective task's README. Apart from these task specific learning points, on the whole, the challenges helped in understanding the better code structure, usage of different technologies and their integration for successful deployment of the application.

## How to Run 

For running each task locally, make sure you have a modern web browser and a text editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom etc. For task1, Node.js and Yarn should be installed in your system. Task1 requires running various Yarn scripts which are specified in the README of Task1 while Task2 and Task3 can be run using a local server or directly in the browser. More details can be found in the respective README.
